Guess who's back, back again?
It's not Shady, you can still tell a friend

It's me, the friendly linux user from the internet, not Eminem. Or maybe you know me from real life, which is likely the case, since that's the only people I've showed this site to.

You've probably seen the title, the big text at the top, telling you what you're about to read. So this is about finishing up the old stuff, getting it done. If you're also a programmer, or anyone else that likes making projects in their freetime. Then you'd know the feeling of having some 2 year old project just sitting and collecting dust.

Is there a better way to find out which projects to finish than writing them all out? So here's a list of all my unfinished projects I think of (and still has a bit of motivation to finish).

- The game
- The CUBE (That's what I call it, it's a speaker that looks like the jukebox from minecraft)
- The media player, that mixes spotify and plex into a TUI app
- The neopixel screen
- Home Assistant automations and stuff (Just wanted to put it here)
- Lego mindstorms programming
- The chess programs (yeah, i got a github repo with some chess programs i wanted to make)

So this is basically those, most of them I will do over the next few months. But the game which is called A New Planet btw, is gonna be my main project with the other ones being side projects I'll do when I'm bored of writing the game.

The main thing I'll focus on for this devlog is the cube, which I'll have this and a few future devlogs about. Then I'll also make some devlogs about the game and the media player, 'cause they are the other ones I have most motivation with rn, but I'll also cover the other stuff in other devlogs.

## The CUBE

Now, you might be asking yourself, or me, what exactly is this CUBE? And you're actually only gonna ask that, if you're one of those people who don't read the paranthesis. These: (if you're reading this, why did they make it so hard to spell?)

But the CUBE, is a big (you should call it big) box. It's 18cm x 18cm x 18cm in size, and yes I had to write cm after every single number there, or else it wouldn't make sense.

And actually you can get a picture of it:

So it's a CUBE that is supposed to look like a [minecraft jukebox](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Jukebox). Which it doesn't right now, but I'll have to paint it later. First of all it needs to have a speaker and be functional.
