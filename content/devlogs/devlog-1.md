Guess who's back, back again?
It's not Shady, you can still tell a friend

It's me, the friendly linux user from the internet, not Eminem. Or maybe you know me from real life, which is likely the case, since that's the only people I've showed this site to.

You've probably seen the title, the big text at the top, telling you what you're about to read. So this is about finishing up the old stuff, getting it done. If you're also a programmer, or anyone else that likes making projects in their freetime. Then you'd know the feeling of having some 2 year old project just sitting and collecting dust.

Is there a better way to find out which projects to finish than writing them all out? So here's a list of all my unfinished projects I think of (and still has a bit of motivation to finish).

- The game
- The CUBE (That's what I call it, it's a speaker that looks like the jukebox from minecraft)
- The media player, that mixes spotify and plex into a TUI app
- The neopixel screen
- Home Assistant automations and stuff (Just wanted to put it here)
- Lego mindstorms programming
- The chess programs (yeah, i got a github repo with some chess programs i wanted to make)

So this is basically those, most of them I will do over the next few months. But the game which is called A New Planet btw, is gonna be my main project with the other ones being side projects I'll do when I'm bored of writing the game.

The main thing I'll focus on for this devlog is the cube, which I'll have this and a few future devlogs about. Then I'll also make some devlogs about the game and maybe the media player, 'cause they're the other ones I have most motivation with rn, but I'll also cover the other stuff in other devlogs (hopefully).

## The CUBE

Now, you might be asking yourself, or me, what exactly is this CUBE? And you're actually only gonna ask that, if you're one of those people who don't read the paranthesis. These: (if you're reading this, you'd know what the CUBE is?)

But the CUBE, is a big box. It's 18cm x 18cm x 18cm in size.

And actually you can get a picture of it:

So it's a CUBE that is supposed to look like a [minecraft jukebox](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Jukebox). Which it doesn't right now, but I'll have to paint it later. First of all it needs to have a speaker and be functional. So I gotta get the parts.

## A lil' update

Soooo, I wrote this devlog like a month ago from rn, and i never finished it or made it public, so it's actually just been sitting and collecting dust, for a whole month. Which is really ironic since I made this devlog about me finishing up my projects ðŸ˜…

And I still haven't made much progress with finding any of the parts for the speaker yet. If I'm gonna be completely honest I also spend most of the time since I wrote about the CUBE first making my game, which I'll probably just follow up with a devlog here later. So you all can stay updated if anyone is reading. So yeah, I don't really have much to say about this, so see you another time I guess.
