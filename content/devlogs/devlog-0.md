Hello everyone, this is the first devlog I made on my website. In this devlog I'll be explaining why I made this website and how I made it using hugo. Ofc we're using catppuccin, because it's goated (or catted idk?)

## Why did I make this website?

So first of all, if you don't know me, I would recommend you checked this page called [about](/about). It's a little page that tells you stuff about me.

So now I guess you got an idea of who I am. Well that's great, let me tell you why I made this website now. So it all started in my backyard, when I was around 12 [{{< tooltip "i think" "Great song btw, you can tell me if I should make a music section on the website" >}}](https://open.spotify.com/track/4f8Mh5wuWHOsfXtzjrJB3t?si=aca5a91e30e54199), and jumped on our trampoline (that was some great times ðŸ¥²). But on the trampoline I got a great idea. So the idea was to make a game (I could code a bit back then, since I'd learned some programming with the micro:bit and Makecode if you know those), a game about jumping, jumping with a trampoline. So what do you think of that idea? You probably need to know a bit more about the idea right, you can hear that in future devlogs? But that was when it all started. So now what does this have to do with the website thing you might ask (you asked that right? Well you get an answer now). So now here we are, in 2025, and I should do something about this idea my brain have been cooking the last few years. The idea has grown bigger, and I've had a raspberry pi 4B which doesn't do anything {{< tooltip "rn" "still means right now" >}}. So this sounds perfect for creating a website, where I could share this idea and how I'll be making it. Then I could get feedback from everyone reading, and I could potentially also share my other projects (some of them is already on [{{< tooltip "github" "Or is it GitHub?" >}}](https://github.com/LukasElias) {{< tooltip "btw" "If you did what I told you to, you read the about page first where I explain what this means" >}}).
