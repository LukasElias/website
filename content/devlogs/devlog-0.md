Hello everyone, this is the first devlog I made on my website. In this devlog I'll be explaining why I made this website and how I made it using hugo. Ofc we're using catppuccin, because it's goated (or catted idk?)

## Why did I make this website?

So first of all, if you don't know me, I would recommend you checked this page called [about](/about). It's a funny little page that tells you stuff about me, and I also made it btw.

So now I guess you got an idea of who I'm. Well that's great let me tell you why I made this website now. So it all started in my backyard, when i was around 12 [i think](https://open.spotify.com/track/4f8Mh5wuWHOsfXtzjrJB3t?si=aca5a91e30e54199), and jumped on our trampoline (that was some great times ðŸ¥²). But on the trampoline I got a great idea. So the idea was to make a game (I could code a bit back then, since I'd learned some programming with the Micro:Bit and Makecode if you know those), a game about jumping, jumping with a trampoline. So what do you think of that idea? Well that was when it all started. So now what does this have to do with the website thing you might ask (you asked that right? Well you get an answer now). So now here we are, in 2025, and i should make something about this idea my brain have been cooking the last few years. The idea has grown bigger, and I've had a raspberry pi 4B which doesn't do anything rn. So, this sounds perfect to create a website where i could share this idea and how I'll be making it. Then I could get feedback from everyone reading this and I could potentially also share my other projects (some of them is already on [github](https://github.com/LukasElias) btw).

## How did I make it?

Well here's the fun part
