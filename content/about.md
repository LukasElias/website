So my name is Lukas Elias Lund Majland, and I live in Denmark.

Anyway, I love programming, and that's why I made this website. I find it really interesting to just be able to create whatever you want. Like who's stopping you from making your own browser engine, to enhance the ecosystem of browsers? Probably time and will, but no one else.
My favourite language is rust, that's why I kinda hate to write JS because it doesn't have types, which is just weird when I'm used to having types in rust. If you wanna check my projects you can check my [GitHub](https://github.com/LukasElias).

And then I use arch {{< tooltip "btw" "btw this means by the way if you didn't know" >}} üêß. I love linux, how should I survive if I used windows. Also when it comes to windows, I like 'em tiled, atleast I use Hyprland at the moment. Wayland is actually quite nice, but {{< tooltip "rn" "rn this means right now, don't know if it'll change" >}} discord and steam is the only major programs I use which still runs on Xwayland which is fine, but not ideal. These two apps are also based on electron, which you'd know if you're a nerd like me‚òùÔ∏èü§ì.

And catppuccin if you haven't realised already is the best color scheme, there's literally no discussion there, but you can discus it in the cusdis comments if you want to. {{< tooltip "Btw" "now this means By the way because the first letter is capital" >}} you can change the theme flavour in the top-right corner (if my frontend skills and your browser are good enough).
